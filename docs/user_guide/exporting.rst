Exporting physiological data metrics
------------------------------------
Another feature of the :py:mod:`phys2denoise` package is the ability to export the computed physiological data metrics to a file, with various parameters.
This can be done using the :py:func:`export_metric` function, which provides the following capabilities:

- Exporting the computed metrics, resampled at the TR of the fMRI data, along with the original data.
- Flagging if the exported data is the convolved version or if the metric contains lags of itself, resulting in appropriate file naming.
- Defining the output file extension and file prefix.
- Defining the number of timepoints to be considered.

The following example shows how to export the computed respiratory variance time using a Physio object. In the following example,
we consider that the Physio object is ``resp``, containing the respiratory data, peaks and troughs.

.. code-block:: python

    from phys2denoise.metrics.chest_belt import respiratory_variance_time
    from phys2denoise.metrics.utils import export_metric

    RVT = respiratory_variance_time(
        resp.data, resp.peaks, resp.troughs, resp.fs, lags=(0, 4, 8, 12)
    )

    export_metric(
        RVT,
        resp.fs,
        tr=1.5,
        fileprefix="data/sub-002_ses-01_task-rest_run-01_RVT",
        ntp=400,
        is_convolved=False,
        has_lags=True,
    )
