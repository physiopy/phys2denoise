    """
    Calculate the cardiac response function using the definition
    supplied in Chang and Glover (2009).

    Inputs
    ------
    samplerate : :obj:`float`
        Sampling rate of data, in seconds.
    oversampling : :obj:`int`, optional
        Temporal oversampling factor, in seconds. Default is 50.
    time_length : :obj:`int`, optional
        RRF kernel length, in seconds. Default is 32.
    onset : :obj:`float`, optional
        Onset of the response, in seconds. Default is 0.

    Outputs
    -------
    crf: array-like
        Cardiac or "heart" response function

    Notes
    -----
    This cardiac response function was defined in [1]_, Appendix A.

    The core code for this function comes from metco2, while several of the
    parameters, including oversampling, time_length, and onset, are modeled on
    nistats' HRF functions.
